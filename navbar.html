                <p>I always dreamt of owning a car in which I can take my family for a drive, But, due to high EMIs, I
                    couldn't afford a car. With host program, I reduced my EMI by sharing the car on weekdays and take
                    my family out on weekends. I am happy that I could finally realise my dream, thanks to host.</p>

                <p>I am an environmentally conscious person. I saw a wonderful opportunity to do something for congested
                    roads and the environment with host program. Sharing my second car on host helps me to reduce
                    traffic and reduce my carbon footprint. And yes, additional earning through my second car is cherry
                    on the cake :)</p>

                <p>I bought a car recently. But, ended up using it only once or twice a week for errands and grocery
                    visits. I saw a great way to earn additional money through the host program while also having the
                    car to myself on weekends for my grocery visits. It is a win-win situation for me.</p>

                <p>I am a travel enthusiast and use my car to explore new places. I prefer taking public transport to
                    office, because of which my car stays idle during the weekdays. So, I decided to share my car on
                    host. Now, I earn extra bucks for my travel expenses :)</p>

                <p>My parents gave me a car so that I can commute safely to college. Since I've been having online

                    pocket money from it. It easy to share the car on host and earn pocket money.</p>
